  title: "Human Learning"
  abstract: |
    \"Before we work on artificial intelligence why don’t we do something about natural stupidity?\” — Computer scientist Steve Polyak
 
    Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Data Mining – yes, there is no way around these buzz words in the modern IT world. The hype regarding virtual agents doing breathtaking things such as optimize the ability to acquire knowledge or retrieving this knowledge as cost-effectively and use-case-oriented as possible – aka learning - is getting bigger and bigger.
 
    Whether it is the velcro inspired by the burdock or thermal insulation systems following the model of polar bears - the nature serves as a model. When it comes to learning - the process of acquiring knowledge or skills through study, experience, or being taught - we are the perfect role model for artificial approaches. But do you even know how you learn?
 
    Learning is not just a must-have ability but your most powerful tool to become your most valuable version. It is an ability you can learn and optimize throughout your whole life. You should never stop learning and learn how to learn. Especially in the IT industry with its constantly expanding concepts and emerging technologies learning is essential.
 
    In this talk we will discover the human learning process. We will uncover common myths and collect learning tips that can immediately be applied. Always in conjunction with the specific learning environment of software development and underlying learning concepts well-known from the area of AI.
