  title: "UX Improvements of Forms - Or: How to Get Users Annoyed"
  abstract: |
    Have you ever wondered why the auto-filling functionality in the browser works really well for some websites but not at all for others? Or have you ever been annoyed when you couldn't use keyboard navigation? Those are some examples of hurdles users have to face when they have to fill out a form on a website. Users regularly encounter forms on websites, and we, as developers, have to implement them. Although we developers also encounter forms as users and know about possible pain points, there are still forms that need better UX out there. Sometimes improving the UX of form fields would be easily achievable. But from my experience, I know that not all of us (myself included) always really think about it while implementing forms.

    In this talk, you will learn about easily achievable UX improvements and why we tend to overlook them. And to spoil it a bit, it is not only about missing types or wrong names for input fields. Furthermore, you will learn why you have to think about biases while improving your UX.
