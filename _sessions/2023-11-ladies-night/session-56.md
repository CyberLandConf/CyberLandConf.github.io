  title: "Open AQAvit Test Strategy"
  abstract: |
    Open AQAvit Test Strategy for OpenJDK binaries are based on open, transparent, robust, and adaptable test suites. We are establishing AQA as the comprehensive open quality standard for OpenJDK verification. AQAvit verification demonstrates that the product is a high-quality offering, ready for enterprise usage, and production quality inclusion criteria. It is one of the three requirements for listing at the Adoptium Marketplace. In this presentation, we take a deep dive into the Open AQAvit Test Strategy: How do we use Eclipse AQAvit tests (that are made available to the public at no charge) to deliver business value to major Java distributors, such as IBM, Red Hat, Microsoft,  Alibaba, and more?  How can we complete 87 million+ tests in a timely fashion with limited machine resources at Eclipse Adoptium and Eclipse OpenJ9 open-source projects. We will talk about our approaches of using smart parallelization, handling copious amounts of verification data, leveraging visualization techniques, implementing Github Actions/workflow, enabling VM cloud, Machine Learning project, and other improvements.
