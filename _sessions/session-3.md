  title: 'Not Dead yet â€“ Java on Desktop'
  abstract: >
    Interestingly a lot of people say Java on desktop is dead and yes it is not in the hyped zone anymore. But on the other hand it is still widely used. This session will try to give an overview on Java on desktop and why it is not dead yet. I will give examples for scenarios where Java on desktop really shines and others where you better choose a web application. It will also show the state of JavaFX with all it's different flavours like standard JavaFX on desktop, on embedded, on mobile using Gluon and on the web using JPro. And of course there will be demos for those different scenarios.
