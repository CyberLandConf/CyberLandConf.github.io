  title: 'Java After Eight'
  abstract: >
    Many projects are still on Java 8 and yet, in just a few days, Java 14 will be out! The small releases after 9 created the illusion of nothing much happening, but nothing could be further from the truth â€“ a lot changes since then that shapes the look of everyday Java code:

    * new language features like switch expressions, 'var', and text blocks

    * new APIs like stack walking and the reactive HTTP/2 client
    
    * additions to existing APIs, like 'Stream' and 'Optional'

    In this talk, we'll take a simple Java 8 code base, update it to 14, and refactor it to use the new language features and APIs. You'll be surprised how much the code changes!
