    Hardware: check?

    Software: check?


    Time and time again we have witnessed mishandling data types such as date/time and currency. Internationalization and accessibility are usually seen as after thoughts and don’t get me started with symmetrical operations on GUIs. What we do should not be a mystery anymore, software is about improving humanity’s quality of life and we rarely think of our kindred beings during analysis, design and implementation.


    We also tend to forget we are part of a organization where different stakeholders sporting a myriad of objectives coexist seeking a range of similar goals.
    Being successful and fulfilled in our daily jobs is not only a matter of technical knowledge, it encompasses multiples skills.


    In this session we will explore and discuss where are the most compelling challenges of software development and our professional careers.
