  title: 'Infrastructure as Code with Terraform'
  abstract: >
    Being able to script my infrastructure is an awesome feature I don't want to miss anymore. Over two years ago I started with Terraform and I'm still in love, but run through some pain points, as well. In this session I want to give you an introduction to scripting your infrastructure with Terraform, talking about best practises as well as tipps and tricks and what I like & don't like. I'll mainly focus on deploying infrastructure to AWS, but Terraform can be used for multiple providers. So let's explore together how far we can go with IaC - Infrastructure as Code. This session requires at least basic understanding of Cloud Computing.
