  title: 'How WE Changed Our World'
  abstract: >
    Half a century of software development has been marked by a surprising phenomenon: we, the developers and architects, have not only repeatedly created new technologies and architectural approaches, but we have also devised methods and procedures that go beyond the mere programming of software. Project managers, users, operations and quality managers have benefited from our innovations. This keynote report on the amazing contributions that our discipline has conceived and developed. After this keynote, you will start your journey to Javaland full of motivation.
